# SPA Resources
These are the resources discussed in the book 
**Single Page Web Applications - JavaScript end-to-end**.

- **Source Code** : The `/listings` directory contains all the source code
from the book, along with a few extras.

- **Quick Reference** : The quick-reference cheat-sheet is a condensation of 
**Appendix A - Code standards**.

- **jQuery Plugins** : If you are looking jQuery plugins, a quick list can be found
[on the plugin site](http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowskihttp://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowski).

## Listings
The listings are provided for reference and collaboration.
You are welcome to create a fork. If you use substantially
the same work in a public project, we would very much appreciate
attribution.

If you improve something, please share by sending a pull request.
If you want something improved, please file a bug.

## Standards
I have posted the code standards here so they may be updated by the
community. Last revision: 2016-11-10.

## Slides
The slides directory holds slides for some of my public presentations.  All of these
have been presented at [HTML5DevConf](http://html5devconf.com/) and various
other locations such as [USF](http://www.usfca.edu/), 
[developer week](http://developerweek.com/), and [Powered by
JavaScript](http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/).
